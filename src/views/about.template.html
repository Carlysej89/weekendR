<h2> About WeekendeR </h2>

  <p> At WeekendeR, I want to connect people to their interests or hobbies and who knows maybe something new! Try a cooking class or a workout group, but the key is to do something. This is for the shy, for the outgoing and for those in between. So spend a weekend doing something new. Be a Weekender</p>
